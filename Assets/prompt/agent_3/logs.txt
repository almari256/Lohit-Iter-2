Questions : ['1. Can you provide information on the quantitative disclosures related to market risk outlined in section 7A of the document?', '2. What are the key elements of the qualitative disclosures about market risk as discussed in section 7A?']

Answers : Certainly! In section 7A of the document, it discusses the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, specifically focusing on interest rate and foreign currency risk management.

- Interest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management: The company monitors its foreign exchange forward and option positions, as well as interest rate swaps to manage risk but there is no guarantee they will fully offset financial impacts from fluctuations. 
- Interest Rate Risk: The company's exposure to changes in interest rates is mainly related to its investment portfolio and outstanding debt, especially sensitive to U.S. interest rate fluctuations.
- Impact on Financial Condition and Operating Results: Changes in interest rates can affect the company's interest earned, fair value of securities, hedging costs, and debt interest payments, potentially influencing financial condition and operating results.

Questions : ['1. What is the specific accounting treatment for changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the item to which the hedge relates on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedge?', '2. How are changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the hedge related item accounted for over the duration of the hedge?']

Answers : The specific accounting treatment for changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the effectiveness assessment of fair value hedges is to recognize them in Other Income and Expenses (OI&E) on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedge. These changes are reflected in OCI (Other Comprehensive Income). (Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | Page 43)
Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the hedge related item are recognized in Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) over the life of the hedge. This applies to both net investment hedges and fair value hedges. For net investment hedges, the excluded amounts are recorded as a part of the cumulative translation adjustment in OCI. In fair value hedges, the excluded amounts are recognized in OI&E on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedge. This accounting treatment ensures that the impact of these excluded amounts is reflected gradually over the duration of the hedge.
